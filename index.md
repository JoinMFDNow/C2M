### Installation
1. Extract all files
2. In Blender, go to **Edit > Preferences**
3. Click the `Install...` button and select **C2M_IMPORTER.zip**

### Usage
1. Load any map (preferrably via private match)
2. Click the circle arrow button to load the map and wait till map data appears
3. Click the box button to extract map data and wait untill everything's exported (might take some time).
4. In Blender, click **File > Import > CoDMap (.c2m)** and import our map.

### Known issues
- Decals use the same UV set as the base material below them so some might look weird
- SpotLight power might be wrong, but most of the data should be correct
- Some shaders aren't supported yet
- I recommend disabling lights you don't see because they seem to be really heavy on Blender.

#### On the roadmap
- CoD4 & BO3 support in the coming weeks
